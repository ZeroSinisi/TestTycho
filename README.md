Trying out Tycho for building Eclipse RCP Applications with Maven.

Helpful Resources
-----------------
*  [The Tesla Tycho Book](https://github.com/tesla/book-tycho/blob/master/en/01-introduction/01-chapter1.md) - I found this to be one of the most helpful resources for going step by step through the process of setting up a Tycho project.
*  [The Vogella Tycho Tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html) - This tutorial was really good and very detailed.  Required a little more familiarity with Eclipse RCP.
*  [The Google+ Eclipse RCP & Plug-in Development Communitee](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/103535641765673802586) - I tried several different places to ask some questions about Eclipse RCP.  I felt like I got some of the most useful feedback from this community.
